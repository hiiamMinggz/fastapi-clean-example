class ValueObject:
    """
    Base class for immutable value objects (VO) in domain.
    Subclassing is optional; any implementation honoring this contract is valid.
    Defined by instance attributes only; these must be immutable.
    For simple type tagging, consider `typing.NewType` instead of subclassing.

    Repr policy: `__repr__` includes only fields with `repr=True`;
    fields with `repr=False` are omitted to avoid leaking secrets.
    If no fields have `repr=True`, '<hidden>' is shown.

    Typing/runtime mismatch when working with class constants:
    By current typing rules, `Final` should wrap `ClassVar` → `Final[ClassVar[T]]`.
    At runtime, `dataclasses.fields()` includes it as an instance field (and with
    `__slots__` it becomes a `member_descriptor`). Use `ClassVar[Final[T]]`
    (or `ClassVar[T]`) so class constants are not treated as instance attributes.
    As of now, mypy does not enforce `Final` inside `ClassVar`; reassignment is
    allowed, so `ClassVar[Final[T]]` is effectively `ClassVar[T]`. We keep `Final`
    for forward-compatibility, expecting future enforcement.
